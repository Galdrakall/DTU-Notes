## Computational Security Framework
Security is defined relative to:
- A security parameter $\lambda$
- A PPT adversary
- A negligible success probability

## Why Randomness Is Needed
Deterministic encryption is predictable.
Randomness ensures:
- Unpredictability
- Protection against pattern leakage
- Resistance to chosen-plaintext attacks

## True Random vs Pseudorandom
True randomness:
- Generated by physical processes
- Expensive and slow

Pseudorandomness:
- Generated by deterministic algorithms
- Indistinguishable from random to efficient attackers

## Pseudorandom Functions ([[PRP and PRF|PRFs]])
A PRF is a keyed function:
$$
F_k : \{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}^n
$$
that behaves like a random function to any efficient observer.

Uses of PRFs:
- Encryption
- MACs
- Key derivation
- Stream ciphers

## Pseudorandom Permutations ([[PRP and PRF|PRPs]])
A PRP is a PRF that is also:
- One-to-one
- Efficiently invertible

Block ciphers (like AES) are modeled as PRPs.

## Relationship Between PRFs and PRPs
- Every PRP is also a PRF
- A PRF is not necessarily invertible
