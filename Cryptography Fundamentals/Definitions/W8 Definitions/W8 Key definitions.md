## Cyclic Group
A group $G$ generated by a single element $g$, such that:
$$
G = \{g^0, g^1, g^2, \dots\}
$$

---

## Generator
An element $g$ that generates all elements of a cyclic group.

---

## Discrete Logarithm Problem (DLP)
Given $g$ and $h = g^x$, it is computationally infeasible to find $x$.

---

## Computational Diffie–Hellman (CDH)
Given $g^a$ and $g^b$, it is infeasible to compute:
$$
g^{ab}
$$

---

## Decisional Diffie–Hellman (DDH)
Given $(g^a, g^b, g^c)$, it is infeasible to decide whether:
$$
c = ab
$$

---

## Diffie–Hellman Key Exchange (DH)
A protocol that allows two parties to agree on a shared secret over a public channel.

---

## ElGamal Encryption
A public-key encryption scheme based on the Diffie–Hellman problem.

---

## Ephemeral Key
A temporary secret key used for a single session to provide forward secrecy.
