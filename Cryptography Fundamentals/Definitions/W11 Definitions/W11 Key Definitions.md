## Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)
Cryptographic algorithms designed to remain secure against attacks by **quantum computers**.

---

## Shor’s Algorithm
A quantum algorithm that efficiently solves:
- Integer factorization
- Discrete logarithms

---

## Grover’s Algorithm
A quantum algorithm that provides a quadratic speedup for unstructured search.

---

## Quantum-Safe
A cryptographic scheme believed to be secure against both classical and quantum attackers.

---

## Lattice-Based Cryptography
Cryptography whose security is based on hard problems in lattices.

---

## Code-Based Cryptography
Cryptography based on the hardness of decoding random linear error-correcting codes.

---

## Hash-Based Signatures
Digital signature schemes built solely from cryptographic hash functions.

---

## Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM)
A public-key primitive used to securely establish a shared symmetric key.
