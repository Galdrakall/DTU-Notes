## Store-Now, Decrypt-Later Attacks
Attackers can:
- Record encrypted traffic today
- Decrypt it in the future once quantum computers exist

This threatens:
- Long-term confidentiality
- Government and medical data

---

## Migration Risks
Switching to PQC too late:
- Exposes archived secrets
- Breaks compliance obligations

---

## Parameter Misconfiguration
If quantum-safe parameters are too small:
- Grover’s algorithm still breaks them
- Security may be overestimated

---

## Implementation Attacks
Many PQC schemes are vulnerable to:
- Timing attacks
- Power analysis
- Fault attacks

Just like classical crypto.

---

## Hybrid Transition Failures
Using:
- Classical crypto alone
- Or PQC alone too early

without proper fallback can cause compatibility or security failures.
